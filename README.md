# ðŸ”–Custom Navigation Drawer

## Built With ðŸ› 

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Duo Navigation Drawer](https://github.com/psdcompany/duo-navigation-drawer) - This Android library provides an easy way to create an alternative navigation drawer for android.Instead of a drawer that slides over the main content of the Activity, this lets the content slide away and reveal a menu below it.
- [Glide Library](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
- [Circle Image View](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) - A fast circular ImageView perfect for profile images. This is based on [RoundedImageView](https://github.com/vinc3m1/RoundedImageView) from Vince Mi which itself is based on [techniques recommended by Romain Guy.](http://www.curious-creature.org/2012/12/11/android-recipe-1-image-with-rounded-corners/)
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
